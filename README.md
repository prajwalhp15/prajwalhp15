# Hey there 👋 I'm Prajwal!

🎓 I'm an engineering student specializing in Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning, now diving deep into the **world of Data Analytics**.

I love transforming raw data into meaningful insights — whether it's building dashboards, predicting trends, or exploring patterns using Python and SQL.  
My journey started with machine learning and GenAI, but I’ve recently shifted gears toward analytics because **data tells stories, and I enjoy being the storyteller.**
